# Braillex
This project is a camera-based real-time text-to-Braille conversion system designed to assist visually impaired individuals by translating printed text into tactile Braille characters using solenoid actuators.Built using Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, this system captures an image, processes the text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and dynamically displays one Braille character at a time using 6 solenoids controlled via relay modules (4-channel and 2-channel).
Features:
Real-time image-to-text extraction via OCR
Hardware-based Braille output using solenoids
Designed for tactile reading â€” one Braille character at a time
Portable and low-cost assistive solution
SSH-enabled remote programming

Hardware Used:
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
Solenoid actuators (6 for Braille dots)
4-channel + 2-channel relay modules
Camera module
Power supply and GPIO wiring

Future Scope:
Multi-character Braille display
Text-to-speech integration
Wireless control and gesture-based navigation
